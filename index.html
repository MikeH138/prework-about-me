      <p>I enjoy listening to music, playing video games, finding shows to binge watch, cooking, going on hikes and camping with friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure what my <i>exact</i> dream job is, but as long as it involves web development, I'll be happy.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Well, I worked in retail from 2013 to 2017, graduated from high school in 2014, and took a few general studies courses at Tunxis Community College in Farmington, CT in 2015 and 2016. 
        In January 2017, I enrolled in courses for machine technology at Asnuntuck Community College in Enfield, CT. However, I realized after the first semester 
        that it just wasn't the right field for me. I had always known that computer science was something I could fall back on, as both of my parents have worked in the field for many years, and so 
        I learned a few things from them growing up. I've always been very tech savvy, and had learned some HTML in middle school. So, in the fall of 2017, I enrolled in Tunxis' Associate of Science in 
        Computer Information Systems Program. I started out studying part-time, but had to pause my studies for a bit due to medical issues. Now, I am just about done 
        with the program. All I need to do now is complete a practicum, but the course is only offered during the spring at Tunxis. The program taught me a broad 
        spectrum of programming languages, technologies and methodologies in the field. I really enjoyed the database design course that I took, but as soon as I started learning web development, I knew right away 
        that it was perfect fit for me. The course I took at Tunxis just covered HTML, CSS, and the very basics of Javascript. I tried studying web development on my own when I had free time, but I wasn't quite sure of 
        what I should focus on learning first. That's why I decided to enroll in this bootcamp, and I'm very excited to get started!
